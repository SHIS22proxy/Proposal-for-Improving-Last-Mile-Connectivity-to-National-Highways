# 🚧 Last-Mile Connectivity to National Highways

A structured approach to improve last-mile road access to India's National Highway (NH) network.

## 🔍 Scope

- Identify underserved areas via GIS
- Design and construct feeder roads
- Integrate with PM Gati Shakti & Bharatmala goals

## ⚙️ Process

1. **Plan**: Map gaps using GIS, consult stakeholders  
2. **Design**: Traffic studies, DPR prep, RoW planning  
3. **Execute**: Fund, tender, build  
4. **Maintain**: Safety infra, IoT/drones, upkeep contracts

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use local materials  
- Align with national infra portals  
- Digitally track progress  
- Include community input

## 🛠 Tools

- GIS platforms  
- CRIF framework  
- PPP models  
- PMGSY/Bharatmala funds

## ⚠️ Issues & Fixes

- **Land delays** → Early engagement  
- **Overruns** → DPR validation  
- **Poor quality** → 3rd-party QA  
- **Flooding** → Elevated roads/drainage
