Introduction","text":"<p>Last-mile connectivity refers to the final leg of a journey that connects the end user or destination with the core transport network\u2014in this case, the national highways. Efficient last-mile access is crucial for enabling seamless freight movement, reducing travel time, improving economic activities in rural and peri-urban areas, and enhancing public mobility.</p> <p>This proposal outlines the technical, infrastructural, and policy-oriented strategies for improving last-mile connectivity to national highways in India.</p> <p>Why it matters: - Boosts logistics efficiency and reduces overall transportation costs. - Enables farmers, SMEs, and local industries better access to national and international markets. - Promotes rural and regional development by linking underserved areas. - Supports the objectives of Bharatmala Pariyojana and PM Gati Shakti Master Plan.</p> <p>Who this guide is for: - Transport and infrastructure planners - Civil engineers and contractors - Government policy-makers - Urban and rural development authorities - GIS analysts and project managers  </p>"},{"location":"#2-key-terminology","title":"2.
